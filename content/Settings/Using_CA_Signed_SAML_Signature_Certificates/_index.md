In order to use CA signed SAML signature certificates you can add the
certificates in the Service Provider Settings section.

Next, export your account's Nirmata SAML Service Provider (SP) metadata
and import that into your IdP. To export the SP Metadata go to [Settings - SAML 2.0](https://www.nirmata.io/webclient/#identityProvider) and
click on the View SP Metadata option. You can then copy the metadata or
download it to a file.

To complete the setup, you can now import the SAML SP Metadata into your
IdP.
