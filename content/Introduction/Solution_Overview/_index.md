Nirmata is designed to complement and complete Kubernetes for
enterprise DevOps teams. Nirmata provides value "below" Kubernetes for
application-aware infrastructure management, manages Kubernetes
components, and provides value "above" Kubernetes for application
delivery and workload management.

The Nirmata solution is non-intrusive and easy to use. It integrates
with your current tools and does not try to hide, or abstract-away, the
powerful abstractions provided by Kubernetes and the
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) layers.

In many ways, Nirmata acts as an "out-of-band" management system. With
Nirmata you can focus on higher-level policy-based development and
operations workflows, but can also directly use the underlying systems
whenever needed.

This unique architectural approach allows full visibility and control,
and yet provides the benefits of a complete platform. You can configure
your cloud or data center resources, using each provider's security and
management best practices and then use Nirmata to orchestrate and manage
applications across providers.

Nirmata provides the following features:

**For IT Ops and Platform Teams**

-   Single management and control plane across multiple Kubernetes
    clusters and across cloud providers.
-   Automated Kubernetes cluster installation, upgrades, and operations
    on any cloud. Nirmata can also discover existing Kubernetes
    clusters, for complete visibility and management.
-   Integrations with all major public and private cloud providers, to
    allow composing clusters from heterogeneous resources, and to fully
    automate container host management.
-   Elastic cluster sizing based on usage and custom metrics.
-   Policy-based integrations for networking and storage.
-   Security integrations for end-to-end control, governance, and
    compliance.
-   Centralized Role Based Access Control (RBAC) with Single Sign On
    (SSO) integrations.
-   Centralized policy engine to inspect and patch workloads based on
    environments.
-   Flexible isolation policies across applications, environments, and
    clusters.
-   Built-in and fully integrated monitoring, alarms, and automated
    remediation.

**For Developers**

-   Complete visibility and lifecycle management of applications and
    environments.
-   Simplified Kubernetes YAML management with validation. Rapidly model
    traditional applications, or compose microservices-style
    applications from Helm charts or image repositories.
-   Secure native access to Kubernetes APIs with full support of all
    workload constructs including Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
-   Integrate with existing build tool and image registries to automate
    "commit-to-deploy" pipelines.
-   Central and secure access to applications, logs, events, and more
    for rapid troubleshooting.
-   Cloud shell to access any container, without requiring cumbersome
    VPN or host SSH access.
