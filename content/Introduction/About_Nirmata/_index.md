Nirmata's mission is to help businesses innovate faster by enabling the
adoption of cloud-native technologies. At Nirmata, we believe that
software can improve our world and we deliver a software platform that
allows enterprise DevOps teams to deliver better software, faster.

Nirmata is a member of the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).
Cloud-native systems are optimized to operate on public and private
cloud-computing platforms. The CNCF defines cloud-native software as
having the following characteristics:

-   **Elastic**: cloud-native systems can automatically scale up or
    scale down.
-   **Resilient**: cloud-native systems can automatically recover from
    common failures.
-   **Observable**: cloud-native systems are designed to provide
    detailed health and status information.
-   **Operable**: cloud-native systems leverage highly automated
    management workflows.

In practice, cloud-native system components are packaged in containers,
leverage container orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes, and are
increasingly designed using [Microservices
style](http://nirmata.com/2014/07/cloud-native-software-microservices/)
architectures.

The Nirmata platform is designed ground-up for cloud-native
applications. Nirmata supports open container technologies and 100%
upstream OSS Kubernetes for scalable and efficient application
management on any public or private cloud, and even bare-metal servers.
