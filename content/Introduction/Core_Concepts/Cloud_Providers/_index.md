Cloud Providers supply resources to run application containers. You can
create one or more cloud providers, setup pools of hosts (Host Groups)
from them, and then compose clusters from the Host Groups.

Nirmata currently supports the following cloud providers:

-   Public Clouds

    -   Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    -   Microsoft Azure
    -   Google Compute Engine
    -   Oracle Cloud Services

-   Private Clouds:

    -   VMware vSphere
    -   OpenStack
    -   Diamanti

-   Direct Connect (any virtual or physical server)

Nirmata can securely manage both public and private clouds, without
requiring any special network or firewall configuration.
