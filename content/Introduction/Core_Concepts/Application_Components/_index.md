A Component is simply part of an Application. A Component maps to
Kubernetes workload API constructs. For example a stateless component
will map to a Deployment and be exposed by a Service, whereas a stateful
component will map to a StatefulSet and may be exposed by a headless
Service. Nirmata's intuitive and powerful user interfaces provide
step-by-step guidance to building Kubernetes applications, but can also
support low-level YAML manipulation for expert users.
